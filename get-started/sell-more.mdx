Atlas is more than just an operating system — it’s a tool to grow your revenue. With the proper setup, Atlas will help you increase sales, give your customers a better experience, and keep them coming back.

## Leverage Atlas to earn more

Here are a few best practices we have noticed not to leave money on the table:

- **Make sure you're listed on Foodpanda, GrabFood, and Deliveroo aggregators.** Atlas Aggregator lets you manage all these platforms in one place. More platforms \> more visibility \> more customers that get to know you.
- **Redirect customers to order directly from you.** Now that your customers know you, encourage them to order through Atlas Online instead of aggregators to save on commission fees. Offer exclusive discounts for your website, exclusive bundles, loyalty rewards, etc.
- **Keep customers coming back with loyalty rewards.** Atlas Loyalty makes repeat visits more likely with points-based rewards, targeted promotions, marketing campaigns, EDM blasts, and exclusive discounts for regulars.
- **Use cross-selling features to increase order value.** Customers are already ordering, so help them add more with smart suggestions. Set cross-selling groups in Scan to Order, Kiosk, and Online from the beginning and iterate to perfect them.
- **Design menus that encourage more spending.** We will break this down in the following next section.

Atlas helps you sell more, earn more, and keep customers coming back — make sure you’re using it to its full potential. If you need help understanding how to do this, please contact us in our dedicated WhatsApp group.

## Set up your menus for success

Menu engineering is about structuring your menu to drive higher spending. With Atlas, you have powerful tools to increase your Average Order Value (AOV) while making it seamless for customers to order more.

Here are some best practices we've noticed:

- **Highlight high-margin items in Atlas Scan to Order, Kiosk and Online.** Re-arrange products on your menu to feature best-sellers, chef’s specials, and high-margin dishes at the top

  of your sections. You can explore adding “Recommended” promotional labels to guide customer choices.
- **Descriptions & photos are essential.** Instead of “Spaghetti with tomato sauce,” try “Slow-simmered tomato sauce over hand-crafted pasta.” Adding pictures to Atlas Online and Kiosk can boost sales by up to 30%.
- **Create combos and bundles.** Increase AOV by offering meal deals. You can create easy-to-add combos (e.g., burger \+ fries \+ drink) at a slightly discounted rate, increasing overall spend while giving customers value. Make sure to create delivery bundles that also serve a specific number of pax.
- **Create modifier groups to upsell.** With Atlas Kiosk and Scan to Order, customers should always see suggestions for add-ons, sides, or drinks when adding products.
- **Optimise pricing presentation.** Set up your more pricey and premium items or choices first to anchor prices.
