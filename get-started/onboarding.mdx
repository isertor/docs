  - New restaurants in the process of onboarding Atlas.
</Info>

Getting started with Atlas is simple. We handle the heavy lifting so you can focus on running your business. From setting up menus to installing hardware, we take care of the details, and let you focus on what matters - your restaurant launch.

Here's a general breakdown on the Atlas onboarding process:

1. **Gathering information**. We collect the necessary details to configure your Atlas setup.
2. **Designing and confirming ordering flows**. We'll work with you to make sure the setup matches your operations.
3. **Getting Atlas ready.** We take care of this while you prepare for launch (this includes menus, diner-interface websites design, setting up products, operating hours, etc.).
4. **Installation and training.** We meet you in person to set up hardware, test it, and train your team. This usually happens within the same day, a few days before your launch.
5. **Go-live**. Once everything is in place, you’re ready to start taking orders. Ensure your onboarder knows this date so they can be on standby to provide support.
6. **Account management.** We will keep ironing out the details after you go live. Some of our plans might not work, so we will use this week to keep training you and calibrating ops.

### What hardware to buy

Atlas runs smoothly on most modern tablets, but these are some recommendations based on our experience. If you have any doubts, it's best to install Atlas on your tablet to see if it performs well.

Minimum specs:

- Android 10\+ or iPadOS 14\+
- 4GB RAM
- Quad-core processor
- 32GB storage

Recommended tablets:

- Android -\> Xiaomi Pad Pro or similar specs
- iOS -\> iPad 9th Gen or newer

### Importance of WiFi

Atlas is a cloud-based system accessed from a browser, so it requires a strong, stable WiFi connection to run smoothly.

We recommend using business-grade routers like Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine UDM-US or ASUS ZenWiFi AX (XT8) for the best performance. 

If you prefer to source your own, this is some of the criteria to consider:

- Strong antenna and good range. Your router should provide at least 30m of range, assuming signal loss through one wall.
- Dual-band or tri-band with WiFi 6. Ensures better load management and future-proofing.
- Must have 2.4GHz support. Best for receipt printer compatibility.
- Handles multiple devices. Should support 16-32 connected clients.
- Nice to have: Dual WAN and/or 4G backup support. Helps maintain connectivity if one network fails.

If possible, avoid 4G-based routers. They tend to have slower speeds and a limited number of supported devices. Low-spec home routers may also have limitations and struggle to handle multiple devices, potentially causing lag.

Atlas printers can connect to your network via wireless WiFi and LAN cable. We recommend using a LAN cable connected to your main network, and wireless connection with your back up network.
