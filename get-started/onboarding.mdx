Getting started with Atlas is simple. We handle the heavy lifting so you can focus on running your business. From setting up menus to installing hardware, we take care of the details, and let you focus on what matters - your restaurant launch.

We set up everything for you—menus, hardware, order flows, and training—so you don’t have to worry about the setup process. Here’s what to expect:

* **Gathering information**. We collect the necessary details to configure your Atlas setup.

* **Designing and confirming ordering flows**. We'll work with you to make sure the setup matches your operations.

* **Getting Atlas ready.** We take care of this while you prep for launch (this includes menus, diner interface skinning, set up products, operating hours, etc.)

* **Installation and training.** We meet you in person to set up hardware, test it, and train your team. This usually happens within the same day, a few days before your launch.

* **Go-live**. Once everything is in place, you’re ready to start taking orders. Ensure your onboarder knows this date so they can be on standby to provide support.

### What hardware to buy
Atlas runs smoothly on most modern tablets, but here’s what we recommend:

Minimum specs:

* Android 10+ or iPadOS 14+

* 4GB RAM

* Quad-core processor

* 32GB storage

Recommended tablets:

* Android: Xiaomi Pad Pro or similar

* iOS: iPad 9th Gen or newer


### Importance of WiFi

Atlas is a cloud-based system that can be loaded from a browser. A strong, stable WiFi connection is essential for things to run smoothly.

For the best performance, we recommend using business-grade routers like "Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine UDM-US" or "ASUS ZenWiFi AX (XT8)". These routers should not compromise speed when multiple devices are connected.

Choose the router based on your restaurant size — smaller spaces need fewer connections, while larger setups require more.
Some of the criteria to consider:

* Strong antenna and good range. Your router should provide at least 30m of range, assuming signal loss through one wall.

* Dual-band or tri-band with WiFi 6. Ensures better load management and future-proofing.

* Must have 2.4GHz support. Best for receipt printer compatibility.

* Handles multiple devices. Should support 16-32 connected clients.

* Nice to have: Dual WAN and/or 4G backup support. Helps maintain connectivity if one network fails.

If possible, avoid SIM routers. They tend to have slower speeds and a limited number of supported devices. Low-spec home routers may also have limitations and struggle to handle multiple devices, potentially causing lag.

To reduce the chances of downtime, it's also a good idea to have a backup WiFi connection, such as a mobile hotspot, so that orders continue to flow even if your primary network goes down.

Atlas printers can be connected via both WiFi and LAN cable for flexibility. We recommend using a LAN cable for the most reliable performance while keeping them connected wirelessly to your backup WiFi.
