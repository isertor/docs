Atlas is more than just an operating system—it’s a tool to grow your revenue. With the right setup, Atlas will help you increase sales, give your customers a better experience, and keep them coming back.

## Leverage Atlas to earn more

Atlas isn’t just about taking orders and optimising your operations — it’s about increasing your sales. A few ideas to not leave money on the table:

* Make sure you're listed on Foodpanda, GrabFood, and Deliveroo. Atlas Aggregator lets you manage all these platforms in one place. More platforms > more visibility > more customers.

* Use cross-selling features to increase order value. Customers are already ordering, so help them add more with smart suggestions. Set cross-selling groups on Scan to Order, Kiosk, and Online from the beginning and iterate to perfect them.

* Keep customers coming back with loyalty rewards. Atlas Loyalty makes repeat visits more likely with points-based rewards, targeted promotions, marketing campaigns, EDM blasts, and exclusive discounts for regulars.

* Maximise diret orders. If you are running deliveries, encourage customers to order through Atlas Online instead of aggregators to save on commission fees. Offer exclusive discounts for your website, exclusive bundles, etc.

* Design menus that encourage more spending.
  Atlas helps you sell more, earn more, and keep customers coming back—make sure you’re using it to its full potential. If you need help understanding how, please contact us in our dedicated WhatsApp group.

## Set up your menus for success

Menu engineering is about structuring your menu to drive higher spending. With Atlas, you have powerful tools to increase your Average Order Value (AOV) while making it seamless for customers to order more.

Here are some best practices we've noticed:

* Highlight high-margin items in Atlas Scan to Order, Kiosk and Online. Re-arrange products on your menu to feature best-sellers, chef’s specials, and high-margin dishes at the top of your sections. You can explore adding “Recommended” promotional labels to guide customer choices.

* Descriptions & photos are essential. Instead of “Spaghetti with tomato sauce,” try “Slow-simmered tomato sauce over hand-crafted pasta.” Adding photos to Atlas Online and Kiosk can boost sales by up to 30%.

* Create combos & bundles. Increase AOV by offering meal deals. With Atlas, you can create easy-to-add combos (e.g., burger + fries + drink) at a slightly discounted rate, increasing overall spend while giving customers value. Make sure to create delivery bundles that serve an specific amount of pax too.

* Create modifier groups to upsell. With Atlas Kiosk and Scan to Order, customers should always see suggestions for add-ons, sides, or drinks when adding products.

* Optimize pricing presentation. Set up your more pricey and premium items first to anchor prices.
