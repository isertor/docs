## Before you begin

Some changes, such as modifying delivery times or fulfilment locations, may require rebooking delivery logistics. Follow all steps carefully to ensure updates are correctly applied to your deliveries.

If you are editing an order from a past date, you must have Manager or above permissions. Set permissions from **Settings > Team members**.

And a few tips:

* When adjusting the "Serving time" for a delivery order, "Preparation time" will happen 30 minutes before the time slot. For example, a 6:30 pm - 7:00 pm delivery order, will be picked up by the driver by 6:00pm.

* After doing the changes, it's best to reprint the Customer receipt (from the "Print receipt" dropdown at the top) and to "Resend customer email" (from the bottom left corner) when possible.
