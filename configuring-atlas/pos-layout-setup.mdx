## Before you begin

This guide will walk you through setting up and customizing your POS layouts in Atlas. You’ll learn how to create layouts, add pages, configure different tile types, and assign layouts to specific outlets.

## Creating a POS Layout

A POS layout organizes how your menu and ordering interface appear on Atlas POS. Creating a layout allows you to customize navigation and product placement for your team.
Follow these steps to set up a new layout:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Atlas Merchant Portal and tap the &#x22;☰&#x22; button in the top-left corner." />

  <Step title="Tap &#x22;Menu Builder&#x22; > &#x22;POS Layouts&#x22;." />

  <Step title="Tap &#x22;Create New POS Layout&#x22;." />

  <Step title="Once the layout is created, proceed to adding pages (see next section)." />
</Steps>

## Adding Pages to a POS Layout

Pages help organize different sections of your POS layout, allowing for easy navigation and a structured menu.
Follow these steps to add new pages to your layout:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Atlas Merchant Portal and tap the &#x22;☰&#x22; button in the top-left corner." />

  <Step title="Tap &#x22;Menu Builder&#x22; > &#x22;POS Layouts&#x22;." />

  <Step title="Tap &#x22;Enter layout manager&#x22; on the layout you want to edit." />

  <Step title="In bottom-left corner, tap &#x22;Add new page&#x22; " />

  <Step title="Enter a name and colour for the page, then tap &#x22;Save&#x22;." />

  <Step title="Navigate to the page by taping its name in the bottom bar.">
    If there are too many pages, scroll horizontally to find it, as it will be at the end. You might resort the page by taping and dragging it too.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You might start adding product or discount tiles in this new page (see next section).

## Adding tiles to your POS

Tiles represent products, discounts, or navigation folders within your POS layout.
Follow these steps to add new tiles to your layout:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Atlas Merchant Portal and tap the &#x22;☰&#x22; button in the top-left corner." />

  <Step title="Tap &#x22;Menu Builder&#x22; > &#x22;POS Layouts&#x22;." />

  <Step title="Tap &#x22;Enter layout manager&#x22; on the layout you want to edit." />

  <Step title="Navigate to the page where you want to add the tile by taping on its name.">
    If there are too many pages, scroll horizontally to find it, as it will be at the end. You might resort the page by taping and dragging it too.
  </Step>

  <Step title="In top-right corner, tap &#x22;Add new tile&#x22; , and select the type of tile to add.">

    * **Page tile** creates an empty folder, for you to add items inside it. Click on it after you've created it to open it.

    * **Product tile** links to an existing product. It's the most common one. An additional "Select" button will display to select the right product.

    * **Discount tile** links to an existing discount. An additional "Select" button will display to select the discount.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a name and colour for the page, then tap &#x22;Save&#x22;.">
    Note you can also enter your own colour code, or tap on the colour to select a predefined one.

    It's best to use darker colours for better visibility (text is white).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Assigning POS layouts to different outlets

If you manage multiple outlets, you can assign specific POS layouts to each location to ensure the correct menu and configurations are in place.
Follow these steps to set up POS layout assignments:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Atlas Merchant Portal and tap the &#x22;☰&#x22; button in the top-left corner." />

  <Step title="Tap &#x22;Menu Builder&#x22; > &#x22;POS Layouts&#x22;." />

  <Step title="Tap &#x22;Assign layouts to outlets&#x22;." />

  <Step title="Select the correct mapping and tap &#x22;Save&#x22;." />
