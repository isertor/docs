## Step 1 – Open the **Integrations** page

## Step 4 – Link each outlet

For every site you're integrating:

1. Enter its **Deliveroo site ID** as Site location ID (e.g. the numver that appers next to your merchant name).
2. Under _Do you want to update your menus through your till?_ choose **Yes – I'll update my menu through my till (POS)**.

<Info>
  If your brand has multiple Deliveroo sites, repeat this step for each one.

## Step 5 – Copy & share your IDs

- A **Brand ID** appears on the next screen.
- Copy both the **Brand ID** and each **Site location ID** and send them to your Atlas onboarding manager.

## Step 6 – After your menu is synced, turn on order flow

Atlas will set up the integration for you and let you know when it's ready. It will take us 1-2 business days. Once that is done:

1. Click **Check menu status** to confirm the upload.
2. Click **Connect your Orders (POS)** to start receiving Deliveroo orders directly in Atlas.

## Step 7 – Verify everything is live

- Back on the Integrations summary make sure all three tags are **green** for each site:

  | Tag             | Meaning              |
  | --------------- | -------------------- |
  | **Menu**        | Menu API connected   |
  | **POS**         | Orders API connected |
  | **Site Detail** | Site metadata synced |

If any tag is orange, wait 20-30 minutes and refresh. Still orange? Reach out to Atlas support.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does the initial menu sync take?">
    Usually under 5 minutes, but large menus may take up to 15 minutes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I keep editing menus in Deliveroo Menu Manager?" defaultOpen="false">
    No. Once you choose **Yes – I'll update my menu through my till (POS)**, Menu Manager is disabled for that site. Make all edits in Atlas instead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if my Brand ID or Site ID is wrong?" defaultOpen="false">
    Disconnect the site in Partner Hub, reconnect it, and enter the correct IDs. Then resend the details to Atlas.
