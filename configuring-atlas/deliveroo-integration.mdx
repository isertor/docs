## Step 1 – Open the **Integrations** page

1. Log in to **Deliveroo Partner Hub**.
2. In the left-hand sidebar click **Integrations**.

## Step 2 – Begin the connection

- Click **Connect sites**. <img src="/images/dev-step4.png" alt="Dev Step4 Pn" />

## Step 3 – Select **Atlas** as your POS

- In _Which POS system do you use?_ search for **Atlas** and select it. <img src="/images/dev-step5.png" alt="Dev Step5 Pn" />

## Step 4 – Link each outlet

For every site you're integrating:

1. Enter its **Deliveroo site ID** as Site location ID (e.g. the numver that appers next to your merchant name).
2. Under _Do you want to update your menus through your till?_ choose **Yes – I'll update my menu through my till (POS)**.

<Info>
  If your brand has multiple Deliveroo sites, repeat this step for each one.
</Info>

## Step 5 – Copy & share your IDs

- A **Brand ID** appears on the next screen.
- Copy both the **Brand ID** and each **Site location ID** and send them to your Atlas onboarding manager.

## Step 6 – After your menu is synced, turn on order flow

Atlas will set up the integration for you and let you know when it's ready. It will take us 1-2 business days. Once that is done:

1. Click **Check menu status** to confirm the upload.
2. Click **Connect your Orders (POS)** to start receiving Deliveroo orders directly in Atlas. <img src="/images/dev-step8.png" alt="Dev Step8 Pn" />

## Step 7 – Verify everything is live

- Back on the Integrations summary make sure all three tags are **green** for each site:

  | Tag             | Meaning              |
  | --------------- | -------------------- |
  | **Menu**        | Menu API connected   |
  | **POS**         | Orders API connected |
  | **Site Detail** | Site metadata synced |

If any tag is orange, wait 20-30 minutes and refresh. Still orange? Reach out to Atlas support.

## Common problems & troubleshooting
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quick checks (fix most issues)">
    - **Site location ID** matches the number next to your site name in brackets in your Deliveroo terminal.
    - The **Brand ID** you shared with Atlas is the one shown on Deliveroo's page during the integration set up process.
    - **Menu / POS / Site Detail** tags are all **green** on Deliveroo. Reload this page to double-check.
    - A **banner/hero image** exists in the Atlas menu you are trying to sync.
    If any are wrong, disconnect the site on Deliveroo Partner's Hub, reconnect, and re-share the correct IDs with Atlas.

    - Confirm with Atlas that the integration team has already set up the integration (we will inform you when done)

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I entered the wrong IDs">

    Usually under 5 minutes, but large menus may take up to 15 minutes.

    No. Once you choose **Yes – I'll update my menu through my till (POS)**, Menu Manager is disabled for that site. Make all edits in Atlas instead.
