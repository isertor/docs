## Before you begin

This guide will run through how to refund payments for paid orders.

You can do partial or full refunds from the Atlas Merchant Portal. If you are processing payments directly with Atlas, refunds happen automatically once triggered, and take 5-10 business days to reflect in diners' bank accounts.

<Warning>
  Note that while order cancellations are reversible, **<u>order refunds are not reversible once initiated</u>.** Before proceeding, make sure you are refunding the correct order and amount.
</Warning>
