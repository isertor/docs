This guide provides ready-to-use discount configurations. Pick a scenario, copy the settings, and adapt to your needs.

For an overview of how discounts work, see **[Discounts](/merchant-portal/add-discounts)**.

## Customer acquisition

Get new customers through the door.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="First order discount" icon="gift" defaultOpen="true">
    Give new customers a reason to try you out. Offer $10 off their first order with a minimum spend to make sure it's worth it.

    <img src="/images/discount-3.webp" alt="Select discount type" />

    **Setup:** Create a **Sub-total discount** named "Welcome - 10 Off Your First Order" with a **fixed amount** of $10. Set the promo code to `WELCOME10` and limit usage to 1 per diner.

    **Make it work:** Add these conditions so only first-time customers can use it:
    - **User is registered** = Yes (required to track order history)
    - **Number of orders is less than** = 1 (ensures it's their first order)
    - **Cart total minimum spend** = $30 (optional, prevents abuse on small orders)

    <img src="/images/discount-5.webp" alt="Setting discount conditions" />

    Both the login and order count conditions are required. Without login, Atlas can't verify if it's the customer's first order.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Free delivery for new customers" icon="truck">
    Delivery fees put people off. Waive them on the first order to remove that barrier.

    **Setup:** Create a **Delivery fee discount** named "Free Delivery - First Order" with a **percentage** of 100%. Set the promo code to `FREEDELIVERY`.

    **Make it work:** Add these conditions:
    - **User is registered** = Yes
    - **Number of orders is less than** = 1
    - **Fulfillment type is** = Delivery
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Loyalty & rewards

Keep your regulars coming back.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Free delivery for members" icon="user-check" defaultOpen="true">
    Reward logged-in customers with free delivery on every order. This gives people a good reason to create accounts.

    <img src="/images/discount-4.webp" alt="Discount settings fields" />

    **Setup:** Create a **Delivery fee discount** named "Member Free Delivery" with a **percentage** of 100%. Leave the promo code blank so it applies automatically.

    **Make it work:** Add these conditions:
    - **User is registered** = Yes
    - **Fulfillment type is** = Delivery

    When there's no promo code, the discount applies automatically at checkout — customers don't need to enter anything.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Birthday month discount" icon="cake-candles">
    Customers like being remembered. Give them 15% off during their birthday month.

    **Setup:** Create a **Sub-total discount** named "Birthday Treat - 15% Off" with a **percentage** of 15% and a **value cap** of $20. Set the promo code to `BIRTHDAY` and limit usage to 1 per diner.

    **Make it work:** Add these conditions:
    - **User is registered** = Yes
    - **Serving date (calendar month)** = matches birth month

    Customers must have their birthday saved in their account profile for this to work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum spend discount" icon="receipt">
    "Spend $50, get $10 off" — customers often add extra items to hit the threshold.

    **Setup:** Create a **Sub-total discount** named "Spend 50 Get 10 Off" with a **fixed amount** of $10. Set the promo code to `SPEND50`.

    **Make it work:** Add this condition:
    - **Cart total minimum spend** = $50

    You can create tiered discounts (Spend $50 get $10, Spend $80 get $20, Spend $120 get $35) using different promo codes for each tier.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Time-based promotions

Fill slower periods or create buzz around specific times.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Happy hour" icon="clock" defaultOpen="true">
    Automatically discount drinks between 5-8pm on weekdays. Once set up, it runs without any manual work.

    **Setup:** Create a **Per eligible item discount** named "Happy Hour 20% Off Drinks" with a **percentage** of 20% and an optional **value cap** of $10 per item. Leave the promo code blank so it applies automatically.

    **Make it work:** Add these conditions:
    - **Cart items include either one of** = (select all drink items)
    - **Serving time is between** = 17:00 – 20:00
    - **Serving day of the week is** = Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri

    Instead of selecting drinks one by one, tag them with "happy-hour" in Menu Builder. Then use **"User or product tags include"** with the tag "happy-hour". When you add new drinks, just add the tag — no need to update the discount.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="1-for-1 promotion" icon="beer-mug-empty">
    Buy one, get one free. Common for beers and appetizers during happy hour.

    **Setup:** Create a **Discount last Y items every N items** discount named "1-for-1 Beer". Set **Last Y items** = 1 and **Every N items** = 2. Use a **percentage** of 100% and turn **Discount modifiers** OFF. Optionally set **Max redemptions per use** = 2 to limit free items per order.

    **Make it work:** Add these conditions:
    - **User or product tags include** = 1for1-beer
    - **Serving time is between** = 17:00 – 20:00 (optional)

    Tag eligible products with "1for1-beer" in Menu Builder first. The discount only applies to tagged items.

    **How it works:**
    - 2 beers → cheapest one free
    - 4 beers → 2 cheapest free
    - 3 beers → 1 free (odd one is full price)

    The system always discounts the cheapest item. A $12 Tiger and a $20 craft beer? The Tiger is free.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Weekend special" icon="calendar-week">
    Automatic 15% discount on Saturday and Sunday.

    **Setup:** Create a **Sub-total discount** named "Weekend Special 15% Off" with a **percentage** of 15% and a **value cap** of $20. Set the promo code to `WEEKEND15`.
