## Customer Acquisition

Discounts designed to attract new customers and encourage them to place their first order.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="First Order Discount" icon="gift" defaultOpen="true">
    **Goal:** Give new customers a reason to try your restaurant with a welcome offer.

    A classic acquisition strategy — offer a fixed discount on the first order to reduce the barrier for new customers. Pair with a minimum spend to protect your margins.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Discount type** | Sub-total discount |
    | **Name** | Welcome - 10 Off Your First Order |
    | **Value type** | Fixed amount |
    | **Value** | 10 |
    | **Promo code** | WELCOME10 |
    | **Max usage per diner** | 1 |

    **Conditions:**

    | Condition | Value | Why |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | User is registered | Yes | Required to track order history |
    | Number of orders is less than | 1 | Ensures it's their first order |
    | Cart total minimum spend | 30 (optional) | Prevents abuse on small orders |

    <Warning>
      Both conditions are required. Without login, Atlas can't verify if it's the customer's first order.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Free Delivery for New Customers" icon="truck">
    **Goal:** Remove the delivery fee barrier to encourage first-time delivery orders.

    Delivery fees are often a friction point for new customers. Waiving them on the first order can significantly boost conversion rates for delivery.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Discount type** | Delivery fee discount |
    | **Name** | Free Delivery - First Order |
    | **Value type** | Percentage |
    | **Value** | 100% |
    | **Promo code** | FREEDELIVERY |

    **Conditions:**

    | Condition | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | User is registered | Yes |
    | Number of orders is less than | 1 |
    | Fulfillment type is | Delivery |
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Loyalty & Rewards

Discounts that reward your existing customers and encourage repeat orders.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Free Delivery for Members" icon="user-check" defaultOpen="true">
    **Goal:** Reward loyal customers with free delivery on every order.

    A powerful retention tool — registered customers get free delivery automatically, creating an incentive to create accounts and order more frequently.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Discount type** | Delivery fee discount |
    | **Name** | Member Free Delivery |
    | **Value type** | Percentage |
    | **Value** | 100% |

    **Conditions:**

    | Condition | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | User is registered | Yes |
    | Fulfillment type is | Delivery |

    <Tip>
      Leave the promo code blank so it applies automatically when logged-in customers order delivery — no code needed!
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Birthday Month Discount" icon="cake-candles">
    **Goal:** Make customers feel special during their birthday month.

    Birthday discounts are a proven loyalty driver. Customers appreciate the personal touch, and it gives them a reason to visit during a specific window.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Discount type** | Sub-total discount |
    | **Name** | Birthday Treat - 15% Off |
    | **Value type** | Percentage |
    | **Value** | 15% |
    | **Value cap** | 20 |

    **Conditions:**

    | Condition | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | User is registered | Yes |
    | Serving date (calendar month) | (matches birth month) |

    <Warning>
      Customers must have their birthday saved in their account profile. The system matches the current month to their birth month.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum Spend Discount" icon="receipt">
    **Goal:** Encourage larger orders by rewarding higher spending.

    "Spend X, get Y off" promotions are effective at increasing average order value. Customers often add extra items to hit the threshold.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Discount type** | Sub-total discount |
    | **Name** | Spend 50 Get 10 Off |
    | **Value type** | Fixed amount |
    | **Value** | 10 |
    | **Promo code** | SPEND50 |

    **Conditions:**

    | Condition | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Cart total minimum spend | 50 |

    <Tip>
      **Create tiered rewards:** Set up multiple discounts with different thresholds — Spend 50 get 10, Spend 80 get 20, Spend 120 get 35. Use different promo codes for each tier.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Time-Based Promotions

Discounts that drive traffic during specific times — perfect for filling slow periods or creating buzz.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Happy Hour" icon="clock" defaultOpen="true">
    **Goal:** Drive traffic during slower afternoon hours with discounted drinks.

    Happy hour is a restaurant staple. This setup automatically discounts drinks during specific hours on weekdays — no staff intervention needed.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Discount type** | Per eligible item discount |
    | **Name** | Happy Hour 20% Off Drinks |
    | **Value type** | Percentage |
    | **Value** | 20% |
    | **Value cap** | 10 per item (optional) |
    | **Promo code** | Leave blank (auto-applies) |

    **Conditions:**

    | Condition | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Cart items include either one of | (select all drink items) |
    | Serving time is between | 17:00 – 20:00 |
    | Serving day of the week is | Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri |

    <Tip>
      **Easier management:** Instead of selecting drinks individually, tag them with "happy-hour" in Menu Builder. Then use the condition **"User or product tags include"** with the tag "happy-hour". When you add new drinks, just add the tag — no need to update the discount.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="1-for-1 Promotion" icon="beer-mug-empty">
    **Goal:** Run a "buy one, get one free" deal — a staple promotion in Singapore.

    The 1-for-1 is perfect for driving volume on specific items. Great for beers, appetizers, or any item you want to push during happy hour.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Discount type** | Discount last Y items every N items |
    | **Name** | 1-for-1 Beer |
    | **Last Y items** | 1 |
    | **Every N items** | 2 |
    | **Value type** | Percentage |
    | **Value** | 100% |
    | **Discount modifiers** | OFF |
    | **Max redemptions per use** | 2 (optional — limits free items per order) |

    **Conditions:**

    | Condition | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | User or product tags include | 1for1-beer |
    | Serving time is between | 17:00 – 20:00 (optional) |

    **How it works in practice:**
    - Customer orders 2 beers → cheapest one is free
    - Customer orders 4 beers → 2 cheapest are free
    - Customer orders 3 beers → 1 free (the odd beer is full price)

    <Warning>
      **Setup required:** Tag eligible products with "1for1-beer" in Menu Builder first. The discount only applies to items with matching tags.
    </Warning>

    <Tip>
      The system always discounts the **cheapest** eligible item. If someone orders a 12 dollar Tiger and a 20 dollar craft beer, the Tiger is free.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Weekend Special" icon="calendar-week">
    **Goal:** Boost weekend traffic with an automatic discount.
