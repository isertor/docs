## Before you begin

Operating hours are your restaurant’s regular opening hours and are synced across all your integrated Atlas channels.

Special hours are used when your regular hours are affected for a day—like on public holidays or special occasions.

Note: For third-party platforms like GrabFood, Deliveroo, or Foodpanda, you’ll still need to manually update operating and special hours in their respective restaurant portals.

## Add operation hours

Set up your restaurant’s regular operating hours so customers know when you’re open for Dine-in, Pickup, or Delivery. You can add multiple time ranges for each day and preview how they appear to diners.

Follow these steps to add operating hours:
