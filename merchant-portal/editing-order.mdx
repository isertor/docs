## Before you begin

This guide will walk you through updating order details, including modifying items, customer information, delivery addresses, and fulfilment type.

Some changes, such as modifying delivery times or fulfilment locations, may require rebooking delivery logistics. Follow all steps carefully to ensure updates are correctly applied to your deliveries.

If you are editing an order from a past date, you must have Manager or above permissions. Set permissions from **Settings > Team members**.

## Adjusting order details

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Option 2: Edit order from Orders page" defaultOpen="true">
    Follow these steps to edit an order one of the Orders pages:

    1. Tap "All orders", "Today's orders" or "Upcoming orders" page.
    2. Tap the order to open it.
    3. Alternatively: Tap the search bar <Icon icon="magnifying-glass" /> and key in your order number > Tap the order.
    4. In the order details modal, tap “Edit order”.
    5. Make your changes:
       1. **Fulfilment type.** Tap any of the three options to change it (Pickup, Delivery or Dine-in). Take note:
          - If you change from Delivery to Pickup, you might want to refund the delivery fee too: In the right side, go to the section "Charges" > Change "Delivery Fee" value to $0.
          - If you change from Pickup to Delivery, follow the same steps to charge any extra delivery fee to customers, updating to the right value.
       2. **Delivery address.** In the top left corner, tap "Delivery address" > Fill up address and unit number > Tap "Add".
       3. **Serving date and time.** Right below address, tap "Serving date" and/or "Serving time" to update order date and serving time slot.
       4. **Customer details.** Scroll down to the bottom left, and adjust Name, Number or Email address for the diner.
       5. **Changing outlet.** In the "Fulfilment type" modal: Tap the "Pickup address" or "Delivery address" to open the address details modal > Change to desired pickup address in the "Select pickup address" list > Tap the right fulfilment type to select it again.
    6. In the top-right corner, tap "Update" to save your changes.
    7. A modal will pop up if any changes affect your driver booking (address, outlet, time, etc.). Tap "Save and update logistics booking".

And a last few tips:

- When adjusting the "Serving time" for a delivery order, "Preparation time" will happen 30 minutes before the time slot. For example, a 6:30 pm - 7:00 pm delivery order, will be picked up by the driver by 6:00pm.
- After doing the changes, it's best to reprint the Customer receipt (from the "Print receipt" dropdown at the top) and to "Resend customer email" (from the bottom left corner) when possible.
