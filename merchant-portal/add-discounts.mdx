## Overview

Discounts let you reduce the price of an order or specific items. You can use discounts to run promotions ("20% off this weekend"), reward customers ("free delivery for members"), or handle service recovery ("complimentary dessert").

Once you create a discount, customers can apply it using a promo code at checkout, or your staff can apply it directly from the POS.

## Discount Types

Atlas offers several discount types. Choose based on what you want to discount and how you want to apply it.

### Order-Level Discounts

These discounts reduce the total price of an order.

| Type | What it does | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sub-total discount** | Reduces the order amount before delivery fees, surcharges, and taxes are added | "$5 off orders of $30 or more" or "15% off your order" |
| **Total discount** | Reduces the order amount after fees and surcharges, but before tax | "10% off your entire bill including delivery fee" |
| **Cash voucher** | Reduces the final payable amount, including taxes | "$20 gift voucher" that covers exactly $20 of the final bill |
| **Delivery fee discount** | Reduces or removes the delivery fee | "Free delivery for orders over $25" |

<Info>
  **Which order discount should I use?**

  - Use **Sub-total** for most promotions — it's the standard choice.
  - Use **Total** if you want the discount to also apply to surcharges.
  - Use **Cash voucher** for gift cards or vouchers where the discount should cover taxes too.
  - Use **Delivery fee** specifically for delivery promotions.
</Info>

### Item-Level Discounts

These discounts reduce the price of specific items rather than the whole order.

| Type | What it does | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Individual item discount** | Staff manually selects which item to discount at the POS | A manager comps a guest's appetizer as a goodwill gesture |
| **Per eligible item discount** | Automatically discounts all items that match your criteria | "20% off all desserts" — every dessert in the cart is discounted |
| **Lowest eligible item discount** | Automatically discounts the cheapest item that matches your criteria | "Cheapest pizza free when you order 3 or more" |
| **Discount last Y items every N items** | Discounts Y items for every N items purchased | "Buy 1 beer, get 1 free" (1-for-1 promotion) |

<Warning>
  **Item discounts require conditions:**
  - **Per eligible** and **Lowest eligible** must be paired with "Cart items include either one of"
  - **Last Y every N** must be paired with "User or product tags include"

  See [Discount Conditions](#discount-conditions) for setup details.
</Warning>

### Stacking Rules

You can combine one order-level discount with one item-level discount on the same order. However, you cannot stack multiple order-level discounts together.

**Allowed:**
- Sub-total discount + Individual item discount ✓
- Delivery fee discount + Per eligible item discount ✓

**Not allowed:**
- Sub-total discount + Total discount ✗
- Two sub-total discounts ✗

## Configuration Settings

When creating a discount, you'll configure these settings:

### Name and Description

| Field | What it does | Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Name** | Shown to customers on receipts and at checkout | Use clear, promotional names like "Weekend Special 20% Off" |
| **Description** | Internal notes for your team | Note the campaign details, e.g., "Summer 2024 marketing campaign" |

### Value

| Field | What it does | Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value type** | Choose **Fixed amount** (e.g., $10 off) or **Percentage** (e.g., 20% off) | Use fixed for vouchers, percentage for promotions |
| **Discount value** | The amount or percentage to discount | — |
| **Value cap** | For percentages: maximum discount amount | Set a cap to protect margins — e.g., "20% off up to $15" prevents large orders from getting excessive discounts |

### Dates

| Field | What it does | Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Redemption start date** | When customers can start using this discount | Schedule future promotions in advance |
| **Redemption end date** | When the discount expires | Always set an end date to avoid forgotten active discounts |

### Promo Code

| Field | What it does | Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Promo code** | The code customers enter to apply the discount | Use memorable codes like "WELCOME10" or "FREEDELIVERY" |

<Tip>
  **No promo code?** Leave this blank to create a POS-only discount. Staff can apply it from a discount tile without needing a code. This is useful for manager discretion discounts or service recovery.
</Tip>

### Usage Limits

| Field | What it does | Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Maximum usage in total** | Total times this discount can be redeemed across all customers | Set a limit for exclusive promotions — e.g., "First 100 customers only" |
| **Maximum usage per diner** | Times each customer can use this discount | Set to 1 for "one per customer" offers |

<Warning>
  **Important:** To track usage per customer, you must identify who they are. Add the condition **"User is registered"** so customers must log in. Without this, the system cannot track individual usage.
</Warning>

### Advanced Settings

| Field | What it does | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Assign payment type for full discounts** | Tags fully comped items (100% off) with a specific payment type | For accurate reporting on complimentary items |
| **Discount modifiers** | Whether add-ons/modifiers are included in the discount | Turn OFF for "1-for-1 oysters" so premium toppings aren't free |
| **Max redemptions per use** | For "Last Y every N" discounts: limits how many times it triggers per order | Prevents "buy 10 get 5 free" — set to 1 for just one free item |

---
