## Overview

Discounts let you reduce the price of an order or specific items. You can use discounts to run promotions ("20% off this weekend"), reward customers ("free delivery for members"), or handle service recovery ("complimentary dessert").

Once you create a discount, customers can apply it using a promo code at checkout, or your staff can apply it directly from the POS.

## Discount types

Atlas offers several discount types. Choose based on what you want to discount and how you want to apply it.

### Order-level discounts

These discounts reduce the total price of an order.

- **Sub-total discount** is the most common choice. It reduces the order amount before delivery fees, surcharges, and taxes are added. Use this for most promotions like "\$5 off orders over \$30" or "15% off your order".
- **Total discount** reduces the order amount after fees and surcharges, but before tax. Use this when you want the discount to apply to surcharges too.
- **Cash voucher** reduces the final payable amount, including taxes. This works like a gift card — a \$20 voucher covers exactly \$20 of the final bill.
- **Delivery fee discount** reduces or removes the delivery fee. Use this for delivery promotions like "Free delivery for orders over \$25".

### Item-level discounts

These discounts reduce the price of specific items rather than the whole order.

- **Individual item discount** lets staff manually select which item to discount at the POS. Useful for service recovery when a manager wants to comp a guest's appetizer.
- **Per eligible item discount** automatically discounts all items that match your criteria. For example, "20% off all desserts" discounts every dessert in the cart.
- **Lowest eligible item discount** automatically discounts only the cheapest item that matches your criteria. For example, "Cheapest pizza free when you order 3 or more".
- **Discount last Y items every N items** is for buy-one-get-one promotions. Set Y=1 and N=2 to create a "Buy 1 beer, get 1 free" deal.

Note that **Per eligible** and **Lowest eligible** discounts must be paired with the condition "Cart items include either one of". And **Last Y every N** discounts must be paired with "User or product tags include". See [Discount conditions](#discount-conditions) for details.

### Stacking rules

Genrally, you cannot stack multiple order-level discounts together. However, you can combine one order-level discount with one Individual item discount (applied only from the POS) on the same order.

## Configuration settings

When creating a discount, you'll configure these settings on the right panel.

### Name and description

The **Name** is shown to customers on receipts and at checkout. Use clear, promotional names like "Weekend Special 20% Off".

The **Description** is for internal notes only — your team can see it but customers can't. Use it to note campaign details like "Summer 2024 marketing campaign".

### Value

Choose a **Value type** of either **Fixed amount** (e.g., \$10 off) or **Percentage** (e.g., 20% off). Fixed amounts work well for vouchers, while percentages work better for promotions.

Enter the **Discount value** — the amount or percentage to discount.

For percentage discounts, set a **Value cap** to limit how much customers can save. For example, "20% off up to \$15" prevents large orders from getting excessive discounts.

### Dates

Set the **Redemption start date** to schedule when customers can start using this discount. This lets you set up future promotions in advance.

Set the **Redemption end date** to make the discount expire automatically. Always set an end date to avoid forgotten active discounts running indefinitely.

### Promo code

The **Promo code** is what customers enter to apply the discount. Use memorable codes like `WELCOME10` or `FREEDELIVERY`.

If you leave the promo code blank, the discount becomes POS-only — staff can apply it from a discount tile without needing a code. This is useful for manager discretion discounts or service recovery.

### Usage limits

**Maximum usage in total** limits how many times this discount can be redeemed across all customers. Use this for exclusive promotions like "First 100 customers only".

**Maximum usage per diner** limits how many times each customer can use this discount. Set to 1 for "one per customer" offers.

To track usage per customer, you must also add the condition **"User is registered"** so customers log in. Without login, Atlas cannot identify who's using the discount.

### Advanced settings

**Assign payment type for full discounts** tags fully comped items (100% off) with a specific payment type. This helps with accurate reporting on complimentary items.

**Discount modifiers** determines whether add-ons and modifiers are included in the discount. Turn this OFF for promotions like "1-for-1 oysters" so premium toppings aren't free too.

**Max redemptions per use** limits how many times a "Last Y every N" discount triggers per order. Set to 1 to prevent "buy 10 get 5 free" — you probably just want one free item per order.

## Discount conditions

Conditions let you specify exactly who can use a discount, what needs to be in the cart, and when it's valid. Add conditions by clicking **"+ Add condition"** at the bottom of the discount form.

### Who can use it

- **User is registered** requires customers to log into their account before they can use the discount. This is required if you want to track usage per customer or limit redemptions per person.
- **User has an account** checks if the customer has an account with your loyalty program. Use this for member-exclusive discounts.
- **User's email domain contains** checks if the customer's email matches a specific domain. For example, use `@yourcompany.com` to create a staff discount that only employees can use.
- **Number of orders is less than** checks the customer's order history. Set this to 1 to create a "first order only" promotion — only customers who haven't ordered before can use it.

### What's in the cart

- **Cart items include either one of** requires at least one of the specified items to be in the cart. This is required for Per eligible and Lowest eligible item discounts.
- **Cart items include all of** requires all specified items to be in the cart. Use this for bundle deals like "Buy burger AND fries, get free drink".
- **Cart items exclude all of** blocks the discount if any of the specified items are in the cart. Use this to exclude alcohol from a general discount.
- **Cart total minimum spend** requires the order to meet a minimum value. Use this for promotions like "\$5 off when you spend \$30".

### Where it works

- **Website is** limits the discount to specific websites. Use this if you run multiple brands and want different promotions for each.
- **Outlet is** limits the discount to specific locations. Use this for grand opening promotions at a new outlet.
- **Fulfillment type is** limits the discount to specific order types (dine-in, takeaway, delivery). Use this for promotions like "Free delivery" that should only work for delivery orders.

### When it's valid

- **Serving date is between** makes the discount valid only during specific dates. Use this for holiday promotions like "Valid Dec 1-25".
- **Serving day of the week is** makes the discount valid only on specific days. Use this for promotions like "Monday Blues 20% Off".
- **Serving time is between** makes the discount valid only during specific hours. Use this for happy hour promotions like "5-8pm only".
- **Serving date (calendar month)** matches the customer's birth month. Use this for birthday rewards — the discount only works during the month of the customer's birthday.

### Using tags

- **User or product tags include** is the most flexible way to target discounts. Instead of selecting items one by one, tag your products in Menu Builder (e.g., "happy-hour", "alcoholic", "desserts"). Then use this condition to target all tagged items with a single discount.

This makes maintenance easier — when you add new drinks to happy hour, just add the tag instead of updating every discount.

## Where discounts work

Customers can use promo codes on **Atlas Online**, **Kiosk**, and **Scan to Order** by entering the code at checkout.

On **POS**, staff can either enter the promo code or tap a discount tile (if you've added one to the POS layout).

Promo codes don't work on third-party platforms like GrabFood, Deliveroo, or other aggregators. Those platforms have their own promotion systems.

## Adding discounts to your POS

To let staff apply discounts without entering a code:

1. Go to **Menu Builder \> POS Layout**
2. Add a new tile and select **Discount**
3. Choose your discount
4. Save the layout

## Best practices

- **Test before launching** by placing a small test order to verify the discount works as expected.
- **Use clear names** so staff instantly understand what "Weekend 20% Off" means without checking the details.
- **Set end dates** to avoid forgotten discounts running indefinitely.
- **Cap percentage discounts** to protect your margins on high-value orders.
- **Pair usage limits with login requirements** — "Max 1 per customer" only works if customers log in, otherwise Atlas can't track who's using the discount.
