Atlas is the easiest way to start, run and grow any restaurant online and offline. Atlas helps restaurants power online storefronts, POS, 3rd party logistics, sync with food platforms, connect with other tools, leverage AI and a lot more.

## Get started
Opener goes here.

## Onboarding
Mention here onboarding is handled by us and that they don't have to worry about anything. E.g. we set up menus, install hardware, train them, etc.

### Overall timeline
- Gathering documentation
- Designign and confirming ordering flows
- Getting ready Atlas (we power through this)
- Installation and training (we'll meet in person for this)
- Go-live

### What hardware to buy
Atlas runs smoothly on most modern tablets, but here’s what we recommend:

Minimum specs:

* Android 10+ or iPadOS 14+
* 4GB RAM
* Quad-core processor
* 32GB storage

Recommended tablets:
* Android: Samsung Tab A8, Lenovo M10
* iOS: iPad 9th Gen or newer

### Installing Atlas on your device

For the best experience, install an Atlas screen shortcut on your device:

Open Atlas Merchant Portal in Google Chrome or Safari.

Tap the menu icon (three dots on Chrome, share button on Safari).

Select Add to Home Screen.

Rename it to Atlas POS and tap Add.

This ensures quick access and smooth performance.

### Importance of WiFi
Atlas is a cloud-based system. That means it is loaded from a browser. A strong, stable WiFi connection is essential to make sure things run smoothly.

For the best performance, we recommend using business-grade routers like TP-Link AX1800 or Asus RT-AX58U. These routers do not compromise speed when multiple devices are connected.

If possible, avoid SIM routers, as they tend to have slower speeds and a low limit on supported connected devices. Low-spec home routers may also have limitations, struggling to handle multiple devices efficiently and potentially causing lag.

To prevent downtime, it's a good idea to have a backup WiFi connection, such as a mobile hotspot, so that orders continue to flow even if your primary network goes down.

Atlas printers can be connected via both WiFi and LAN cable for flexibility. For the most reliable performance, we recommend using a LAN cable while keeping them connected wirelessly to your backup WiFi as well.

### Order flows to consider
Atlas is flexible, but planning your ordering flow is key to avoiding operational issues. A general rule of thumb:
* Decide channels where you'll accept orders. If you want to reduce manpower, have least an Scan to order and/or Kiosk channel.
* Determine when payment happens. Pay first is usually the easiest option, especially for kiosks and STO. Pay later works best for full-service restaurants and for staff to upsell, but will require more manpower to track open orders.
* Consider how food will reach diners. Pickup counters need clear signage and a notification so diners know when their food is ready. Consider buzzers, a simple number caller, or Atlas Dispatch. If food is served, design well the expeditor stations so that they don't become a bottleneck. 

### Successfull restaurant setups
To help ilustrate the above, let's define a few real-life successfull setups:
### Quick-service setup 
* Atlas products: Atlas Scan to Order, Atlas Kiosk, Atlas Dispatch, Atlas Aggregator and Atlas Online
* When payment happens: Before the meal
* How food reaches diners: Self-collection at pickup counter.

### Leverage Atlas to earn more
Atlas isn’t just about taking orders and optimising your operations — it’s about increasing your sales. A few ideas to not leave money on the table:

- Make sure you're listed on Foodpanda, GrabFood, and Deliveroo. Atlas Aggregator lets you manage all these platforms in one place. More platforms > more visibility > more customers.

- Use cross-selling features to increase order value. Customers are already ordering,  sohelp them add more with smart suggestions. Set cross-selling groups on Scan to Order, Kiosk and Online from the beginning, and iterate to perfect it.

- Keep customers coming back with loyalty rewards. Atlas Loyalty makes repeat visits more likely with points-based rewards, targeted promotions, marketing campaigns, EDM blasts, and exclusive discounts for regulars. 

Atlas helps you sell more, earn more, and keep customers coming back—make sure you’re using it to its full potential. If you need help to know how, please contact us in our dedicated WhatsApp group.
