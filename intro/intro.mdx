Atlas is the easiest way to start, run and grow any restaurant online and offline. Atlas helps restaurants power online storefronts, POS, 3rd party logistics, sync with food platforms, connect with other tools, leverage AI and a lot more.

## Get started

Getting started with Atlas is simple. We handle the heavy lifting so you can focus on running your business. From setting up menus to installing hardware, we take care of the details, and let you focus on what matters - your restaurant launch.

## Onboarding

We set up everything for you—menus, hardware, order flows, and training—so you don’t have to worry about the setup process. Here’s what to expect:

### Overall timeline

* **Gathering information**. We collect the necessary details to configure your Atlas setup.

* **Designing and confirming ordering flows**. We'll work with you to make sure the setup matches your operations.

* **Getting Atlas ready.** We take care of this while you prep for launch (this includes menus, diner interface skinning, set up products, operating hours, etc.)

* **Installation and training.** We meet you in person to set up hardware, test it, and train your team. This usually happens within the same day, a few days before your launch.

* **Go-live**. Once everything is in place, you’re ready to start taking orders. Ensure your onboarder knows this date so they can be on standby to provide support.

### What hardware to buy

Atlas runs smoothly on most modern tablets, but here’s what we recommend:

Minimum specs:

* Android 10+ or iPadOS 14+

* 4GB RAM

* Quad-core processor

* 32GB storage

Recommended tablets:

* Android: Samsung Tab A8, Lenovo M10

* iOS: iPad 9th Gen or newer

### Installing Atlas on your device

For the best experience, install an Atlas screen shortcut on your device:

1. Open Atlas Merchant Portal (https://portal.atlas.kitchen) in Google Chrome or Safari.

2. Tap the menu icon (three dots on Chrome, share button on Safari).

3. Select "Add to Home Screen".

4. Rename it to Atlas and tap Add.

5. Open the new desktop app, and log in with your credentials.

### Importance of WiFi

Atlas is a cloud-based system that can be loaded from a browser. A strong, stable WiFi connection is essential for things to run smoothly.

For the best performance, we recommend using business-grade routers like "Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine UDM-US" or "ASUS ZenWiFi AX (XT8)". These routers should not compromise speed when multiple devices are connected.

Choose the router based on your restaurant size — smaller spaces need fewer connections, while larger setups require more.
Some of the criteria to consider:

* Strong antenna and good range. Your router should provide at least 30m of range, assuming signal loss through one wall.

* Dual-band or tri-band with WiFi 6. Ensures better load management and future-proofing.

* Must have 2.4GHz support. Best for receipt printer compatibility.

* Handles multiple devices. Should support 16-32 connected clients.

* Nice to have: Dual WAN and/or 4G backup support. Helps maintain connectivity if one network fails.

If possible, avoid SIM routers. They tend to have slower speeds and a limited number of supported devices. Low-spec home routers may also have limitations and struggle to handle multiple devices, potentially causing lag.

To reduce the chances of downtime, it's also a good idea to have a backup WiFi connection, such as a mobile hotspot, so that orders continue to flow even if your primary network goes down.

Atlas printers can be connected via both WiFi and LAN cable for flexibility. We recommend using a LAN cable for the most reliable performance while keeping them connected wirelessly to your backup WiFi.

### Ordering flows to consider

Atlas is flexible, but planning your ordering flow is key to avoiding operational issues. A general rule of thumb:

* Decide channels where you'll accept orders. If you want to reduce manpower, have at least a Scan to order and/or Kiosk channel.

* Determine when payment happens. Pay first is usually the easiest option, especially for kiosks and STO. Pay later works best for full-service restaurants and staff to upsell, but will require more manpower to track open orders.

* Consider how food will reach diners. Pickup counters need clear signage and a notification so diners know when their food is ready. Consider buzzers, a simple number caller, or Atlas Dispatch. If food is served, design the expeditor stations well so they don't become a bottleneck.

### Successful restaurant setups

To put this into perspective, here are real-life setups that work:

* **Quick-service setup:**

  * **Atlas products:** Atlas Scan to Order, Atlas Kiosk, Atlas Dispatch, Atlas KDS, Atlas Aggregator, Atlas Online

  * **When payment happens:** Before the meal

  * **How food reaches diners:** Self-collection at a pickup counter.

## Leverage Atlas to earn more

Atlas isn’t just about taking orders and optimising your operations — it’s about increasing your sales. A few ideas to not leave money on the table:

* Make sure you're listed on Foodpanda, GrabFood, and Deliveroo. Atlas Aggregator lets you manage all these platforms in one place. More platforms > more visibility > more customers.

* Use cross-selling features to increase order value. Customers are already ordering, so help them add more with smart suggestions. Set cross-selling groups on Scan to Order, Kiosk, and Online from the beginning and iterate to perfect them.

* Keep customers coming back with loyalty rewards. Atlas Loyalty makes repeat visits more likely with points-based rewards, targeted promotions, marketing campaigns, EDM blasts, and exclusive discounts for regulars.

Atlas helps you sell more, earn more, and keep customers coming back—make sure you’re using it to its full potential. If you need help understanding how, please contact us in our dedicated WhatsApp group.
