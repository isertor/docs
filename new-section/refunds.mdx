## Before you begin

This guide will run through how to refund payments for paid orders.

You can do partial or full refunds from the Atlas Merchant Portal. If you are processing payments directly with Atlas, refunds happen automatically once triggered, and take 5-10 business days to reflect in diners' bank accounts.

Note that while order cancellations are reversible, order refunds are not once initiated. Make sure you are refunding the correct order and amount before proceeding.

## Processing a full refund (and cancelling the order)

Use this option when you do not want to charge this amount to the diner, which means the sales amount is not collectible. There are two options to cancel and refund an order:
