    4. Open a browser and enter 10.10.100.254 in the search bar.

    5. When prompted, enter admin for both the username and password.

    6. Once inside the printer's configuration menu, you can change the language (Mandarin or English) from the top-right corner.

    7. Click SCAN to detect available WiFi networks (this may take a couple of minutes).

    8. Select your 2.4GHz WiFi network, click the dial button beside it, and then press OK.

    9. Enter your WiFi password, click Show Password to confirm it's correct, and press Save.

    10. Click Restart to finalise the connection.

    11. Within a few minutes, a successful connection receipt should print.		*This may take up to 10 minutes in some cases.*	&#x9;

    12. If a connection failed receipt prints instead, go through the guide again and ensure all steps were followed correctly. Also, check your WiFi stability.
