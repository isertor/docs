Atlas printers can be connected to WiFi wirelessly using one of these two methods:

* Mode A: QR pairing with WeChat.

* Mode B: Manual pairing via browser (recommended).

    Follow these steps to cancel and refund an entire bill from Atlas POS:

    1. Connect to the outlet's WiFi network (must be 2.4GHz).

    2. Download WeChat and create an account.

    3. Locate the small black button at the back of the printer.

    4. Press and hold the button for 2 seconds and release → A receipt will print.

    5. Repeat step 4 → A receipt will print with a QR code.

    6. Open WeChat and scan the QR code.

       * Note: This connects the printer to WiFi.

    7. Enter your WiFi password and confirm.

    * Note: Ensure Bluetooth and Local Network access are enabled if needed.

    8. On the next screen, select the Printer network and click Connect.

    9. Wait for the printer to connect and print a success receipt.

    10. If the connection failed receipt prints, repeat the steps or check your WiFi stability.
