## Before you begin

Availability conditions allow users to control when a product or section is visible on the menu. These conditions help manage inventory, seasonal items, or time-limited offers.

## Setting Availability Conditions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the product to edit">
    * Navigate to **Menu Builder > Menus > Edit Menu** > Find the product.

    * Or go to **Menu Builder > Products** > Find the product.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Product Details modal">
    Tap on the product to open its settings.

    ![Product Details](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8aee948b-9843-4907-8b92-c79e8ee8b8fc/300c0cfd-5f89-4063-9c5f-5542423045fc/Untitled.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scroll down to the `Availability` section">
    Locate the availability settings within the product details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add availability conditions">
    Use availability rules to determine when a product is available or unavailable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Availability Conditions

Atlas allows multiple conditions using **`AND`** and **`OR`** statements:

* **`AND`** – **All** conditions must be met for the product to be available or unavailable.

* **`OR`** – **At least one** condition must be met for the product to be available or unavailable.

* **No conditions added** – The product will be displayed as always available unless manually marked as unavailable.

### Example: Hiding an Item for a Specific Period

To temporarily remove an item from the menu:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set a date range">
    Apply **March 1 to March 15** as the active date range.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select `Unavailable if`">
    Choose this option to ensure the product remains hidden during the selected period.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  **Tip:** Use availability conditions to automate menu updates and prevent manual changes during seasonal closures or promotions.
