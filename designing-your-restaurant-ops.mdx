### Ordering flows to consider

Atlas is flexible, but planning your ordering flow is key to avoiding operational issues. A general rule of thumb:

* Decide channels where you'll accept orders. If you want to reduce manpower, have at least a Scan to order and/or Kiosk channel.

* Determine when payment happens. Pay first is usually the easiest option, especially for kiosks and STO. Pay later works best for full-service restaurants and staff to upsell, but will require more manpower to track open orders.

* Consider how food will reach diners. Pickup counters need clear signage and a notification so diners know when their food is ready. Consider buzzers, a simple number caller, or Atlas Dispatch. If food is served, design the expeditor stations well so they don't become a bottleneck.

### Successful restaurant setups
